# A Scalable Deep Learning Solution for Multiclass Classification of Book Covers


This project proposes a methodology to define, train and evaluate a CNN model, with the goal of classify books by category, given the relative cover image, placing emphasis on the scalability of the solution on large datasets.

### Requirements
It is required to fill out the first cell of the notebook with Kaggle personal username and key.

```python
os.environ['KAGGLE_USERNAME'] = "<username>"
os.environ['KAGGLE_KEY'] = "<key>"
```
